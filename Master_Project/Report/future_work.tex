\chapter{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Memory bandwidth and saturation.
	\item More accelerators. 
	\item Stay in hardware, instead of going back to software for next layer. 
	\item Test acceleration of layer C5.
	\item Hardware accelerate float to fixed. 
	\item Stream data through accelerator. Dont fill buffer first.
	\item Training on hardware. 
	
\end{itemize}
