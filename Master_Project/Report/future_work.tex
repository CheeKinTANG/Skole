\chapter{Future work}

Developing a convolutional neural network hardware accelerator is a complex and time consuming task. There are thus several improvements that we would wish to have implemented and tested, but sadly we ran out of time. In this chapter we will give an overview the planned, but unfinished, features we would wish to extend to our current architecture. The features are listed in a priority order, and we will give some indication of how much is needed to implement said features.


\begin{enumerate}                           

\item \textbf{Hardware accelerate float to fixed.}
  
	\item \textbf{More accelerators in parallel.}
	\item \textbf{Stream data through accelerator. Dont fill buffer first.}
	\item \textbf{Memory bandwidth and saturation.}
	\item \textbf{Stay in hardware, instead of going back to software for next layer}
	\item \textbf{Test acceleration of layer C5.}
	\item \textbf{Training on hardware.}
	
\end{enumerate}
