This project will explore the design and implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in hardware with the intention of improving energy efficiency over traditional implementation in software on a general-purpose CPU. The overall goal is to build a standalone system that (time permitting) could be trained interactively by a user (e.g., to recognise handwriting or faces from a webcam video stream) and then demonstrate learned patterns through recognition of unseen samples.

The energy efficiency of the hardware implementation should be evaluated against software equivalent running on a general-purpose CPU and this evaluation should constitute a major aspect of the report.

The suggested platform is the Zynq FPGA board, but the student can also investigate and weigh the advantages and disadvantages other platforms such as SHMAC.
