Task 2

An acceptor takes the input and outputs either yes or no, depending on whether the input was a legit input. 
A lexical analyzer also checks if the input is legit, but it also groups up the input-characters into meaningful 
lexemes and outputs a token for each lexeme. A token is on the form <token-name, attribute-value>.
