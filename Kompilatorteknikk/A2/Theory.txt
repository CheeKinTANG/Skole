Task 1

b) A language which wants an equal, but variable, amount of different symbols can not be desicribed by a regual expression. 
E.g. you want a fixed number of a's, followed by an equal number of b's. Regual expressions are not defined to accept such a language, because 
the size of the DFA required to reconize such a language is unbounded. In other words, it becomes really impractical, unless we have a unlimited amount of 
memory. 

Task 2

a) Ambiguous grammar is grammar that can be represented by more than one parse tree. It's problematic because it causes programs to become undeterministic, i.e. 
your program may provide different result for the same input. This will result in buggy, unpredictable and unusable programs.
