\chapter{Related Work}

In \cite{Farabet2009} a CNN was implemented on a Virtex-4 SX35 FPGA from Xilinx. In this implementation all the fundamental computations was hard-wired, and controlled by a 32bit soft processor using macro-instructions. Training was done offline, and a representation of the network was provided to the soft processor. With this implementation they were able to process a $ 512 \times 384 $ grayscale image in 100\textit{ms}, i.e. 10 frames per second.
