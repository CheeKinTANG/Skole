\chapter{Introduction}


The aim of this project is to explore the implementation of machine learning algorithms in hardware (e.g., FPGA) with the intention of improving energy efficiency over traditional implementation in software. The algorithm should be modularly developed so that it can be potentially used as an accelerator tile within a multi-core heterogeneous computing platform such as SHMAC.

For a given algorithm, e.g., a deep neural network, the student will:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Explore the feasibility and expected efficiency gain over a general-purpose CPU (e.g., is there a need?)
	
	\item A literature survey on related techniques, hardware implementations, etc.
	
	\item Allocation of components between hardware and software (e.g., according to a HW/SW co-design methodology)
	
	\item If time permits, adapting the module for use as a SHMAC accelerator tile
	
\end{itemize}
