\chapter{Future work}

As mentioned, due to lack of time the Imagezor architectre was not deployed on a FPGA and tested on it. 

Hardware accelerating the training of the network was not explored in this report. This is a interesting topic that should be investegated, especially with warhouse computing in mind. With the vast amount of data available with Big Data, warhouse clusters have a vast potential for learning patterns in this data, be it for object recognition in images or other patterns. Since the primary cost of warhouse computing is the power bill, clusters focusing on neural networks would greatly benefit from a power efficient hardware accelerator for training.
